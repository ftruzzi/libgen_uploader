    <h1>Copyright</h1>

    <p>You can create all sorts of pages that are not chapters as well, and simply give them different names.  As an idea you could use a page like this, and either list your name as the copyright or list it under another copyright, such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License">GNU Licesnse</a></p>
